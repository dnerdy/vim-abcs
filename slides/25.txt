"gq" is for "Gentleman's Quartly?" (style)

WRAP THE FOLLOWING LINES BY USING VISUAL LINE MODE AND "gq"


This is some poorly formatted text.
Some lines are short.
Some lines are way too long... I mean longer than our linter would be happy with at least.
Give it some style.


NOW SET THE FILE TYPE TO PHP ":set filetype=php"

# gq even works with comments. Try reformatting this comment
# line you formatted the paragraph above. Then
# follow the directions below.

MAKE THE COMMENT ABOVE LOOK LIKE:

                        # gq even works with comments. Try reformatting this
                        # comment line you formatted the paragraph above. Then
                        # follow the directions below.

(use "V" to select the comment, then ">" and "." followed by "V" and "gq")

// This works for all sorts of comments. We set the file type to php because php supports several different comment styles.
