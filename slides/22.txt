GO TO THE END OF THE FILE WITH "G"


This is some poorly formatted text.
Some lines are short.
Some lines are way too long... I mean longer than our linter would be happy with at least.
Give it some style.

SET THE FILE TYPE TO PHP ":set filetype=php"

# gq even works with comments. Try reformatting this comment
# line you formatted the paragraph above. Then
# follow the directions below.

COPY THE ABOVE BLOCK (visual line mode, "y" and "p")
THEN INDENT THE BLOCK AND GIVE IT SOME STYLE.

// This works for all sorts of comments. We set the file type to php because php supports a bunch of comment types.
