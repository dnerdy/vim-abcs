"c" is for "change"

"i" is for "in"

'Change everything in these quotes to your name'

(move to within the quotes and use "ci'"... "change" "in" "quote")

TRY "ci{" (change in brackets)

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int i = 1;
    i += 1;
    return 2;  // 3
}

TRY ci" (change in double quote)

(maybe use "/" to search for the string "value" below)

{
    iLikeThisKey: "But I do not like this value",
}
