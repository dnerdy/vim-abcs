A quick note about modes

Vim has two main modes: command mode and insert mode

If the text you're typing isn't showing up,

    ...you're probably in command mode

If the text you're typing is showing up,

    ...you're in insert mode

After entering text, type ESC (that's the escape key) to go back to command
mode. You'll usually want to go back into command mode when you finish typing
something.
