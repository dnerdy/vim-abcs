"c" is for "change"

"i" is for "in"

Change "everything in these quotes to your name" (use ci"... change in quotes))

TRY ci{ (change in brackets)

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int i = 1;
    i += 1;
    return 2;  // 3
}

TRY ci' (change in single quote)

(maybe use "/" to search for "value")

{
    iLikeThisKey: 'But I do not like this value',
}
